        I started out being a go getter coming out of college. 
                I looked for opportunity in expanding my skills and getting on the field experience. 
                As time passed, lots of turmoil in the world and in my personal life, I couldn't find work. 
                In order to compensate, I had to think outside the box to expand. 
                After trying my hand in different vocations such as video editing, running a business, and customer service, I want to get out there and look for technical work. 
                It is still my passion and want an opportunity to be involved. 
                Even if temporary or if its just a chance to hear me out, I still will find it as a learning experience as I attempt to dive into a field that want to work hard on. 
                If I am able to adapt into many things, then being able to work in a new vocation should be a rewarding experience.

        Thank you for time and have a nice day.          </p>
